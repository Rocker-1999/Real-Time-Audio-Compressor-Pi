Real time audio compressor that runs on Raspberry Pi. Made as my final project design for Advanced Programming Applications CET-4370C.

NOTE: This was not completed/partially working as there is a notable issue with the real time processing. While the audio compression itself does work, the real time processing has notable clicking. This is left as it was submitted for my final project with no modifications.
